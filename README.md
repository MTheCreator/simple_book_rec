# simple_book_rec
This is the simplest book rec ever.


The main idea is to create a recommender using simple OOP concepts, data structures learned in the 2nd semester at UM6P School of Computer Science.

We still need to create two datasets: Books.JSON ( 1000 book) and Users.JSON ( 20 000 user).

Hope we have Enough Time :/.
